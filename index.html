                        <strong>Dear Zavanah-rae, my love.</strong>
                        <p>
                            I know that I've made empty promises before, and I know that
                            this will sound like one to, but I will show you that I'm
                            changing and I'll be a better man when you come back to  us.
                            I'll always be by your side (it may not be physically), so
                            just message me, call me, whatever. I'll be there for you.
                            I know I'm still lacking but I'll prove with my actions that
                            I truly care, and adore you, and I want to be present in our
                            relationship. I trust that you'll come back when you're ready,
                            and I'll stay for as long as I physically can, so you can take
                            your time in thinking about us. If you're ever in need of help
                            I'm always just one text, or one call away, and I'll always be
                            supporting you from behind. I will always love you so very much
                            and I'll keep on being yours, and yours alone. I love you sooo
                            very much darling, and I know this is kind of long and formal
                            but I just wanted to say that even though I'm not used to
                            showing what I feel, I'll try as much as I can if it's for
                            you, and  I'll do my best to not make you feel alone in the
                            situations that you're going through. I love you so very much
                            my dear princess, mwuaaahh♥♥
